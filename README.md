# Shopping Cart

This project is a simple **Shopping Cart**. It allows users to browse desserts, add items to the cart, view totals, and clear the cart.

## Features

- Browse a list of available dessert items.
- Add products to the cart.
- View total number of items, subtotal, taxes, and total cost in real-time.
- Show and hide the shopping cart.
- Clear the shopping cart with a confirmation dialog.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling of the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing cart functionality, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

## How It Works

1. **Add to Cart**: Click the "Add to cart" button next to a dessert item to add it to your cart.
2. **View Cart**: Click the "Show/Hide Cart" button to toggle the visibility of the cart.
3. **Clear Cart**: Click the "Clear Cart" button to remove all items from the cart.
4. **Calculations**:
   - **Subtotal**: Sum of all the item prices in the cart.
   - **Taxes**: 8.25% tax rate applied to the subtotal.
   - **Total**: Sum of subtotal and taxes.

## What I Learned

- How to use JavaScript to manage state (like the items in the cart).
- Dynamically updating the DOM with user actions (adding/removing items).
- Implementing calculations for taxes and totals.
- Handling events such as button clicks and managing the visibility of sections of the page.
